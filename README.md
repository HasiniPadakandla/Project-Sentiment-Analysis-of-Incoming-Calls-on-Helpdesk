Sentiment analysis of incoming calls on help desk systems aims to enhance customer experience by automating the identification of customer emotions expressed during interactions. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze call transcriptions and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. By extracting valuable insights from customer conversations, the system enables helpdesk teams to respond proactively, improving issue resolution and customer satisfaction. The project demonstrates the potential of AI- driven sentiment analysis to streamline customer service operations, providing real- time feedback and actionable intelligence to helpdesk operators. Additionally, this approach reduces manual effort and fosters data-driven decision-making to enhance overall operational efficiency.
